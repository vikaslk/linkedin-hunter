## 🎓 Interview Preparation

### Common Interview Questions (Your Answers):

**"Why leave clinical practice?"**
> "I never left - I still see patients at Total Care Clinic. But I realized I could create more impact solving systemic problems than treating patients one by one. My clinical background makes me better at healthcare strategy because I understand real-world constraints."

**"Why startups/consulting vs. traditional hospital roles?"**
> "I've run hospital operations at scale - up to 1800 beds. I know what works and what doesn't. Now I want to either: (a) help a startup build healthcare the right way from scratch, or (b) as a consultant, help multiple organizations improve faster. It's about multiplying my impact."

**"What's your biggest achievement?"**
> "Building a $6M education business from zero at GE HealthCare. Started with blank canvas, built relationships with India's top clinicians, launched programs that generated $250K quarterly. That business still runs and is growing. It taught me healthcare entrepreneurship at scale."

**"Why this geography?" (if applying to UAE/Singapore)**
> "I want international exposure while staying close to high-growth Asian healthcare markets. [UAE/Singapore] offers the best combination of: advanced healthcare systems to learn from, thriving health-tech ecosystem, and regional platform for scale."

**"What's your superpower?"**
> "I bridge two worlds that rarely connect: clinical medicine and business strategy. I can speak doctor-to-doctor but also read a P&L, build a go-to-market strategy, and scale operations. That rare combination creates unique value in healthcare transformation."

### Preparation Resources:
- Review company's recent funding/news
- Understand their product deeply (use it if possible)
- Research founders/interviewers on LinkedIn
- Prepare 3-5 questions to ask them
- Have stories ready for each key strength (use STAR method)
- Practice with Claude (mock interviews)
