# Dr. Vikas L Krishna - Professional Profile Summary

## 30-Second Elevator Pitch

"I'm a physician-turned-healthcare-strategist with 14+ years building businesses at the intersection of clinical care and innovation. I built a $6M education market from scratch at GE HealthCare and ran 1800-bed hospital operations. Now I'm looking to bring clinical expertise and business acumen to a health-tech startup or consulting firm that's solving real healthcare problems."

## 60-Second Version

"I started as a practicing physician, then realized I could create more impact by solving systemic healthcare problems. Over 14 years, I've worked across the full spectrum - from bedside clinical care to corporate strategy at GE HealthCare, to running operations at large hospitals.

My biggest win? Taking a zero-revenue education initiative at GE and turning it into a $6M business across India, scaling a network of key opinion leaders 8X in 5 years.

I'm now seeking a role where I can combine clinical insights with business strategy - ideally at a health-tech startup where I can help shape product direction and scale operations, or at a top-tier healthcare consulting firm solving complex industry challenges."

## 2-Minute Deep Dive

"My journey has been about expanding impact. As a physician, I could help one patient at a time. But I kept seeing systemic problems - inefficient operations, poor patient experiences, technology that didn't work for clinicians.

So I got my MBA and moved into healthcare administration. At Sriramachandra Hospital, I managed 1800 beds and 5000 employees. I streamlined pharmacy operations, cutting costs by ₹1 crore monthly while improving margins from 20% to 40%. I also reduced hospital attrition from 20% to 8% by building better HR systems.

Then GE HealthCare gave me a blank canvas - create an education business in India. I spent 7 years building relationships with India's top clinicians, launching upskilling programs, and generating $250K quarterly revenue. That business grew from zero to $6M and is still growing.

I've also done stints at Aster, Cloudnine, and Innov4Sight, always focused on the same thing: how can we use better systems, processes, and technology to deliver better healthcare?

Most recently, I founded Total Care Clinic to test ideas about patient-centered, digital-first primary care. We're seeing 60%+ retention with average 20-minute consults - proving that when you give doctors time and tools, outcomes improve.

What excites me now? Health-tech companies that understand healthcare's real problems. Startups building telemedicine platforms that actually work for doctors. Consulting firms helping hospitals digital-transform without losing the human touch.

I want to be in a role where my clinical background gives me credibility, but I'm solving problems at scale through strategy, operations, and technology - not just treating patients one by one."

## Core Value Proposition

### What Makes Dr. Vikas Unique

**The Rare Triple Threat:**
1. **Clinical Credibility:** MBBS-trained medical physician (NOT dentist) with 14+ years of practice
2. **Business Acumen:** MBA + P&L management + revenue generation + strategic consulting
3. **Execution Experience:** Led teams, managed operations, scaled businesses

Most healthcare consultants lack clinical experience. Most doctors lack business training. Dr. Vikas has both.

**Consulting Experience Note:** Dr. Vikas has strong strategic consulting skills from independent consulting at Innov4Sight Health (health-tech startup) and unlocking special deals at GE HealthCare Education Team. While not a formal Big 4/MBB alum, he brings client-side strategic problem-solving and business development expertise.

## Roles to AVOID (Critical Filters)

### ❌ Do NOT Apply To:
1. **Co-founder roles requiring personal investment** - "Invest ₹10L and join as co-founder"
2. **Sweat equity only** - No salary, equity only compensation
3. **BDS/MDS specific roles** - Dentistry positions (you are MBBS - medical)
4. **"Big 4 alumni required" or "Ex-MBB only"** - Roles explicitly requiring formal Big 4/MBB background
5. **Pure clinical roles** - No strategy/leadership component
6. **Medical writing/content** - Not your core strength
7. **Delhi/NCR/Mumbai locations** - Outside target geography

### ✅ DO Apply To:
1. **Equity + competitive salary** - Both components present
2. **Roles valuing "strategic consulting" or "independent consulting"** - Your background fits
3. **"Healthcare operations + strategy"** - Perfect match
4. **"Clinical + business background"** - Your unique value prop
5. **"Build from zero" or "Scale operations"** - Proven track record

## Red Flags to Address Proactively

### Potential Concern: "Too Many Job Changes"
**Response:** "I've intentionally built a diverse portfolio across startups, corporates, and hospitals to understand healthcare from every angle. Each role added specific skills - hospital operations, consulting, business building, digital health. Now I'm ready to go deep in one organization for the long term."

### Potential Concern: "Why Leave Clinical Practice?"
**Response:** "I never left - I still see patients at Total Care Clinic. But I realized I could create more impact solving systemic problems than treating patients one by one. My clinical background makes me better at healthcare strategy because I understand real-world constraints."

### Potential Concern: "Overqualified / Too Expensive"
**Response:** "I'm looking for the right fit, not just the biggest paycheck. For a startup with strong equity and mission alignment, I'm flexible on base salary. What matters is long-term value creation and meaningful work."

### Potential Concern: "Why Healthcare Consulting If You Haven't Consulted?"
**Response:** "I've done strategic consulting at Innov4Sight Health, a health-tech startup, designing scalable systems and securing ₹50L in research grants. At GE HealthCare, I unlocked special deals worth $150K quarterly through strategic partnerships - essentially consultative selling and business development. While I don't have Big 4 on my resume, I've solved the types of problems consultants tackle - strategic planning, market creation, operational transformation. My advantage? I've run the operations consulting firms advise on, giving me credibility consultants often lack."
