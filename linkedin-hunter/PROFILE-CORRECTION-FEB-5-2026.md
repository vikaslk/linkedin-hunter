# Profile Correction - GE HealthCare Story (Feb 5, 2026)

## Critical Correction Required

### BEFORE (Inaccurate)
"As part of GE HealthCare's 40-person Education team led by Padmaja Sajja, I helped scale quarterly revenue from $80K → $250K"

### AFTER (Accurate)
"I joined GE HealthCare Education AFTER founder Padmaja Sajja departed. I inherited her foundation and drove execution with a lean 3-12 person team (down from 40). Scaled quarterly revenue from $80K → $250K."

## Key Facts (Corrected)

### About Padmaja Sajja
- ✅ Founded/built the GE HealthCare Education business foundation
- ✅ Had LEFT GE before Dr. Vikas joined
- ❌ Dr. Vikas **NEVER worked with** Padmaja Sajja
- ✅ Dr. Vikas inherited what she built

### Team Structure
- **40 members:** Under Padmaja's manager (broader organization, NOT Dr. Vikas's team)
- **Dr. Vikas's manager scope:** 9-person team
- **Core team when joined:** 12 members
- **Core team when left:** 3 members (resource efficiency story)

### Dr. Vikas's Contributions
1. **Joined:** Feb 2019 (post-Padmaja departure)
2. **Left:** Dec 2023
3. **Phase:** Execution and scaling (NOT foundation/strategy creation)
4. **Team size:** 3-12 people over 5 years
5. **Achievement:** $80K → $250K quarterly revenue (3X growth)
6. **Key activities:**

   - Global partnerships ($150K quarterly)
   - Customer conversations
   - Operational execution
   - Program delivery

## Why This Framing is Stronger

### For Startups:
✅ **"Do more with less" story**
- 3X revenue growth with 1/4 team size
- Resource efficiency and operational leverage
- Execution without large teams
- Perfect for lean startup environments

✅ **Inherited foundation, drove execution**
- Not claiming to be strategy creator
- Honest about standing on someone else's shoulders
- Shows execution ability (often harder than strategy)
- Demonstrates adaptability (came into existing system, improved it)

### Honest Positioning:
- ❌ Don't claim: "I built this from zero"
- ✅ Do claim: "I scaled this 3X with a lean team"
- ❌ Don't claim: "I worked with Padmaja Sajja"
- ✅ Do claim: "I joined after Padmaja left and inherited her foundation"

## Updated Elevator Pitches

### 30-Second Version:
"I'm a physician-turned-healthcare-strategist with 14+ years. At GE HealthCare, I joined after the founder left and scaled quarterly revenue from $80K to $250K with a lean 3-12 person team. Also ran 1800-bed hospital operations. Now bringing clinical expertise, business acumen, and resource efficiency to health-tech startups."

### 60-Second Version:
"I joined GE HealthCare Education after founder Padmaja Sajja departed. I inherited her foundation and drove execution with a lean 3-12 person team (down from 40). We scaled quarterly revenue from $80K to $250K. My contributions: KOL network 8X scaling, global partnerships ($150K quarterly), customer conversations, operational execution - proving I can do more with less."

## Application Talking Points

### When Asked: "Tell me about your GE experience"

**Good Response:**
"I joined GE HealthCare's Education business after the founder left. I inherited a solid foundation and my challenge was to scale it with a lean team - we went from 12 people down to 3 by the time I left. Despite shrinking resources, we grew quarterly revenue from $80K to $250K. I did this by focusing on relationship building with India's top clinicians, managing global partnerships, and driving operational efficiency. It taught me that with the right focus, you don't need big teams to create big impact."

**Avoid:**
- "I built the $6M education business from scratch"
- "I worked with Padmaja Sajja to create..."
- "I led a 40-person team..."

### When Asked: "What's your biggest achievement?"

**Good Response:**
"Taking over GE HealthCare's Education business after the founder left and scaling it 3X with a fraction of the team size. We went from 12 people to 3, but revenue went from $80K to $250K quarterly. I did this through obsessive focus on relationships - scaled our key clinician network 8X - and operational efficiency. It's the ultimate 'do more with less' story, which I know startups need."
