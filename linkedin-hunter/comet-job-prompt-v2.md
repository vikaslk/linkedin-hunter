## CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS

Want to adjust the search? Modify these sections before pasting:

Find: `TIME FILTER: Posted within PAST 10 DAYS`
Change to: `PAST 14 DAYS` or `PAST 21 DAYS` (for broader search)

### To Prioritize Specific Geography:
In SEARCH STRINGS section, put your target city FIRST in Boolean search
Example: `(Singapore OR Dubai OR Bangalore)` → prioritizes Singapore

### To Focus on Startups Only:
Add to EXCLUDE section:
`❌ Corporate hospital roles`
`❌ Established pharma companies`

### To Broaden to More Geographies:
Add to TARGET GEOGRAPHIES:
`7. 🇹🇭 Thailand - Bangkok`
`8. 🇵🇭 Philippines - Manila`

---

## TROUBLESHOOTING

**Issue: Comet returns "No results found"**
- Increase date range to 14 or 21 days
- Remove some geography filters
- Simplify search strings (use fewer Boolean operators)

**Issue: Too many irrelevant results**
- Tighten CRITICAL EXCLUSIONS
- Add specific company size filters
- Focus on 2-3 geographies only

**Issue: Comet times out or stops mid-search**
- Run Phase 1 separately first
- Then run Phase 2+3 with Phase 1 results
- Or reduce from 48 search combinations to 24 (focus on top 2 geographies)

**Issue: LinkedIn URLs don't work**
- Copy URL and paste in incognito browser
- Or search company + role title manually on LinkedIn
- This happens when jobs are very recent or region-locked

---

## ADVANCED USAGE TIPS

### Weekly Cadence:
**Sunday Morning:** Run full 3-phase search with past 10 days filter
**Wednesday Evening:** Quick check - run just for Dubai + Bangalore, past 3 days
**Friday Afternoon:** Follow up on applications, research networking targets

### Track Your Results:
After each Comet run, note:
- How many 90-100 score jobs? (Target: 3-5 per week)
- Which geography had most opportunities?
- Which role type most common?
- Any new companies to research?

Use this data to refine search parameters over time.

### Combine with Direct Research:
After Comet identifies top companies, also:
1. Visit their careers pages directly
2. Check their LinkedIn company page for recent hires
3. Look for press releases about funding/expansion
4. Find mutual connections for warm intros

---

## SUCCESS METRICS

### Good Comet Run:
- ✅ 15-25 jobs scored 75+
- ✅ 3-5 jobs scored 90+
- ✅ At least 10 from Tier 1 or Tier 2 roles
- ✅ Mix of geographies represented
- ✅ 5+ jobs with equity mentioned

### Weak Comet Run:
- ⚠️ < 10 jobs scored 75+
- ⚠️ Zero jobs scored 90+
- ⚠️ All from Tier 3-5 roles
- ⚠️ Only 1-2 geographies represented

If you get a weak run: Broaden date range to 14 days, or expand geographies.
