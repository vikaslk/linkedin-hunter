## Key Insights So Far

1. **Eyva's Success Formula** (Preliminary Hypothesis):
   - Lower psychological barrier (one-time vs. recurring subscription)
   - Wellness positioning vs. medical device (avoids regulatory scrutiny, less intimidating)
   - Family sharing model (cost-effective value proposition)
   - Strong D2C marketing with exclusivity tactics
   - Good-enough accuracy for prevention (pre-diabetes screening vs. insulin management)

2. **Critical for MetaCoach**:
   - Eyva succeeds without medical-grade accuracy because target use case is prevention/wellness
   - Device + coaching could be powerful (Eyva lacks ongoing behavioral support)
   - One-time device + recurring coaching = hybrid revenue model to explore

3. **Questions to Answer**:
   - Does Eyva have doctor/coaching support? (Doesn't appear so from initial research)
   - What are actual user complaints? (Need Reddit/review deep dive)
   - Is ₹30k Aarca bundle viable vs. ₹16.65k Eyva? (Need Aarca product clarity)

**To Resume**: Continue with Apollo Ask Apollo web searches, then complete MediBuddy analysis to finish Day 1.
