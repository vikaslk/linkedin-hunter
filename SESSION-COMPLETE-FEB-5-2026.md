## 🎯 Critical Profile Corrections Applied

### GE HealthCare Story - NOW ACCURATE

**BEFORE (Inaccurate):**
> "Member of 40-person GE HealthCare Education team led by Padmaja Sajja"

**AFTER (Accurate):**
> "Joined GE HealthCare Education AFTER founder Padmaja Sajja's departure. Inherited her foundation and drove execution with a LEAN 3-12 person team (down from 40 under previous leadership). Scaled quarterly revenue from $80K → $250K."

### Key Facts:
- ✅ NEVER worked WITH Padmaja Sajja (she left before you joined)
- ✅ Team: 3-12 people (NOT 40)
- ✅ Manager scope: 9-person team
- ✅ Achievement: 3X revenue growth with 1/4 team size
- ✅ Framing: "Do more with less" - perfect for lean startups

### Files Updated:
- ✅ `comet-job-prompt-v2.md` - Candidate profile section
- ✅ `profile-summary.md` - All elevator pitches and achievement sections
- ✅ `PROFILE-CORRECTION-FEB-5-2026.md` - Complete correction documentation

## 🔄 Next Steps (Your Choice)

### Option A: Use Comet Only (Recommended to Start)
1. Run Comet today using v2.0 prompt
2. Apply to top matches this week
3. Track results and response rates
4. Refine search criteria based on feedback
5. Run weekly for 2-3 weeks
6. **Decision point:** If Comet works well, continue. If limitations frustrate you, proceed to Phase 2.

### Option B: Start Phase 2 POC (Advanced)
1. Open new context window in Claude
2. Read `/HANDOFF-PHASE-2.md` for complete specifications
3. Build basic MCP server + Proxycurl integration (2-3 hours)
4. Test with 5-10 companies to validate approach
5. Iterate based on results
6. Build full agent if POC successful (10-15 hours)

**Recommendation:** Start with Option A. Use Comet for 1-2 weeks to validate your target roles and geographies. Then build Phase 2 MCP agent with confidence in your search criteria.
